## DistilBERT trained on GoEmotions dataset (Text Classification).

#### Disclaimer - GoEmotions is a multilabel and multiclass dataset, but I have made it multiclass by keeping just the first label in multilabel rows.

#### Files:
> goemotions-distilbert.ipynb contains all training and basic inference code.


#### Future:
- [ ] Convert to TFLite for mobile devices.
- [ ] Deploying model.
